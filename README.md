# Eject

Eject is a ~~bad idea~~ utility that allows developers to transition from a `.xib` file to programatic view layout. This is done by generating code to construct the view hierarchy that was created by the `.xib` file, and then removing the `.xib` file. One common pain point of Interface Builder is a layout becomes more and more dynamic, `.xib` files are less and less helpful as more and more state is managed programatically. This tool lets developers use Interface Builder without that concern, giving them an Eject button to hit when Interace Builder starts getting in the way.

### But But
Yes, I understand that there a million ways why this is a bad idea.

### Does it work?
Conceptually -- (aka No)
